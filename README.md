#  Bananaespresso

A small, fun build created during my first real steps into **3D design** and **KiCad** (coming from EasyEDA).  
It’s nothing more than a simple “U-shaped” pad — basic, slightly janky, but charming in its own way.  
Alignment might be *questionable*, but hey… if it works, it works!

This board does exactly what it needs to: **8 keys and 4 LEDs**.  
What else do you really need in life?

## PCB

The PCB is, uh… *a bit of an eyesore*.  
Messy? Yes. Functional? Also yes. And that’s what matters.

##  Schematic

A simple, minimal schematic — but fairly clean for what it is.
