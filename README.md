First time working in 3D! Same with kicad. (i used easyeda before this). It's nothing much more than a "U" shaped pad. Very basic and possibly even funnily sub-par.
Alignment might not be done well by the mm, but hey, if it works it works!
It doesn't do much, just 8 keys, and 4 leds, what else do you need in life, right?
